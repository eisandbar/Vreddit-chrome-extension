# Vreddit-chrome-extension
A google chrome extension to make downloading vreddit videos a lot easier

Installing:
1) Clone this repo
2) Go to the extensions settings in chrome
3) Turn on developer mode
4) Click load unpacked and find this directory
5) Turn on the extension

Usage:
When navigating to a reddit page with a vreddit video e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/r5nut7/just_a_cute_puppy_to_brighten_up_your_day/
Right click anywhere on the page and click on "Download vreddit video". The download will begin automatically.

Future:
- Custom video names
- Choose quality

Not sure this extension will be updated as it already fits my needs
